## 🖥️ [Coder 1.0](coder.html)
Coder is a self-contained, zero-dependency web development environment engineered as a single HTML file that operates entirely client-side to ensure absolute data privacy and offline capability, utilizing the modern File System Access API for native file reading, writing, and creation directly from the user's local drive. The application provides a distraction-free, dark-themed interface featuring a custom-built textarea editor with toggleable line numbering and a specialized highlighting layer that visualizes trailing whitespace, supported by an intelligent input system that handles automatic indentation, smart bracket and quote completion, and bulk text manipulation via indentation commands. To streamline development workflows, the editor includes a robust modal-based search and replace engine with match counting, specific keyboard shortcuts for rapid semantic navigation (jumping immediately to style, script, or body tags), and code hygiene utilities that can detect trailing whitespace or strip redundant empty lines to clean up source code. Beyond editing, the tool facilitates rapid iteration with a "Preview in New Tab" function, protects work via unsaved changes detection (preventing accidental data loss on close), and offers a built-in help system detailing the extensive keyboard shortcut mapping for a keyboard-centric user experience.
