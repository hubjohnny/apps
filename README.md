**Portable & Offline Ready:** All games and tools in this repository are completely self-contained within their individual HTML files. This means there are no external dependencies, assets, or internet connections required to use them. To run a project, simply download the single file to your computer and open it in any modern web browser. It functions perfectly as a standalone application, making it ideal for offline use.
