**Portable & Offline Ready:** All games and tools in this repository are completely self-contained within their individual HTML files. This means there are no external dependencies, assets, or internet connections required to use them. To run a project, simply download the single file to your computer and open it in any modern web browser. It functions perfectly as a standalone application, making it ideal for offline use and easy distribution. To run the file directly online, just slap [https://hubjohnny.github.io/](https://hubjohnny.github.io/) in front of it.  

I regularly update and enhance my apps, so consider [following me on GitHub](https://github.com/hubjohnny).
