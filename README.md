### 💲 [Sokoban Puzzle Game](sokoban.html)
**[Sokoban](sokoban.html)** is a classic puzzle game where you control a warehouse keeper, represented by the @ symbol, with the goal of pushing all the boxes ($) onto the designated storage spots (.). You must navigate through a maze of walls (#) and carefully plan each move, as you can only push one box at a time and never pull them, meaning it is easy to get stuck if you act without thinking. My version of the game features over 45,000 verified levels, offering a massive variety of logic challenges. Don't forget to check out my **[Sokoban Level Editor & Player](sokobaned.html)**, where you can design and test your own levels, or play from the massive library of levels with more stylized graphics.

### 🟢 [Ludo Board Game](ludo.html)
**[Ludo](ludo.html)** is a classic strategy and luck board game for two to four players, designed to be simple and competitive. The main goal is to race your four coloured tokens from your starting area, around the entire track, and into your central 'home' column. Players take turns rolling a single die. To get a token onto the track, you must roll a six. Once a token is moving, you advance it by the number shown on the die. The key element of the game is conflict: if your token lands on a square occupied by an opponent's token, the opponent's token is sent back to its starting area, forcing them to roll a six again to re-enter. The first player to successfully move all four of their tokens into their colour-matched home triangle in the centre of the board wins the game. In my version of the game, you can play against three AI opponents or turn on "Autopilot" to let an AI take over your player and show you how the game is played.

### 🖥️ [Coder 1.0](coder.html)
**[Coder](coder.html)** is a self-contained, zero-dependency web development environment engineered as a single HTML file that operates entirely client-side to ensure absolute data privacy and offline capability, utilizing the modern File System Access API for native file reading, writing, and creation directly from the user's local drive. The application provides a distraction-free, dark-themed interface featuring a custom-built textarea editor with toggleable line numbering and a specialized highlighting layer that visualizes trailing whitespace, supported by an intelligent input system that handles automatic indentation, smart bracket and quote completion, and bulk text manipulation via indentation commands. To streamline development workflows, the editor includes a robust modal-based search and replace engine with match counting, specific keyboard shortcuts for rapid semantic navigation (jumping immediately to style, script, or body tags), and code hygiene utilities that can detect trailing whitespace or strip redundant empty lines to clean up source code. Beyond editing, the tool facilitates rapid iteration with a "Preview in New Tab" function, protects work via unsaved changes detection (preventing accidental data loss on close), and offers a built-in help system detailing the extensive keyboard shortcut mapping for a keyboard-centric user experience.
